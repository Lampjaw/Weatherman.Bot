**Must have Embed links permissions!**

## Commands

`?w <location>` Returns the current conditions for a location    
`?wf <location>` Returns the five day forecast for a location    
`?sethome` Sets a home location so if you just type `?w` or `?wf` without any additional input it defaults to your home.    
`?setprefix` Only server admins can use this one. Sets the prefix for your Discord server. Defaults to `?`

All commands can also be used with `@Weatherman` instead of the prefix.
